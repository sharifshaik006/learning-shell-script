#while re running the script it wont be rewritting it. overwritting without promt by ( -o) is the solution

problems................

scripting is running though i am not root user
we need to edit the file from CLI
fetch the password and pass somewhere else
need to handle the errors

Enhancement:

Output

Understanding:
How set command came to know that there was an error

PROBLEM WITH THE SCRIPT...........
it wont stop in middle if any command is failure, it just proceed by default ( set -e) is the solution
