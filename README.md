In Linux basics we discussed that linux doesnt have extensions to files it consider extensions as filename itself, However as a user we have to understand what type of file it is & easy way of understanding it is by extensions. That is the reason we always create extensions for the file we create.

In shell we are going to create scripts and we are going to give extensions to understand it as a shell scripts

we are learning bash shell here

so the file names are .bash or even lot people write as .sh linux doesnt care its only for our understanding for extensions.

I prefer using .sh than .bash
